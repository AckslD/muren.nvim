Neovim plugin for doing multiple search and replace with ease.

:warning: This plugins is in its early days so feel free to open issues if you
stumble on issues, have ideas or are missing some things to configure.


WHAT DOES THIS PLUGIN DO      *muren.nvim-muren.nvim-what-does-this-plugin-do*

Sometimes you may want to do some number of search-and-replacements that follow
a certain structure. Lets say you have some variables named `a_0`, `a_1` and
`a_2` but you instead want to rename them to `x`, `y` and `z`. Using builtin
methods there are a few ways to do that (and maybe more which I don’t know):


- Do the replacements one by one manually.
- Do the first replacement and then edit the command in the command-line window (`q:`).
- Come up with some complex regex.

All of which I find somewhat cumbersome.

With `muren` ui, you get two buffers where you can enter a sequence of patterns
in the left one (one per line) in the right buffer enter the replacements in
the corresponding row. For example it would look something like:

>
    a_0 | x
    a_1 | y
    a_2 | z
<

where you can use all your vim-skills to populate the buffers (eg `<C-v>`,
`<C-a>` etc etc).

See |muren.nvim-examples| below for some screencasts of how this looks like
with `muren`.


FEATURES                                      *muren.nvim-muren.nvim-features*


- Define and apply multiple replacements.
- Toggle between simple and 2-step replacements (eg to swap names), see |muren.nvim-showcases|.
- Interactively changes options, including which buffer to apply to.
- Preview changes.
- Keep patterns and options when toggling ui.
- Change between only current buffer vs all files in `dir` (default to `cwd`) with given file pattern (default to `**/*`).


INSTALLATION                              *muren.nvim-muren.nvim-installation*

Use your favorite plugin manager, eg with `lazy.nvim`:

>lua
    {
      'AckslD/muren.nvim',
      config = true,
    }
<

:exclamation: requires nvim 0.9.


USAGE                                            *muren.nvim-muren.nvim-usage*

By default the following commands are created:


- `MurenToggle`: Toggle the UI.
- `MurenOpen`: Open the UI.
- `MurenClose`: Open the UI.
- `MurenFresh`: Open the UI fresh, ie reset all settings and buffers.
- `MurenUnique`: Open the UI populating the patterns with all unique matches of the last search.
    See |muren.nvim-examples| below for why this can be very powerful.

The UI uses the following normal mode keymaps (buffer local): * `q`: Quit UI. *
`<Tab>`: Swap between _patterns_ and _replacements_ pane. * `<C-s>`: Swap
between _patterns_/_replacements_ and _options_ pane. * `<CR>`: Apply
replacements (only in _patterns_ or _replacements_ pane). * `<CR>`: Toggle/pick
options (only in _options_ pane). * `<Up>/<Down>`: Scroll preview up/down.

See below for how to configure there.

Pass `create_commands = false` to `require('muren').setup` to not create them.

You can also access this using lua as the following functions:


- `require('muren.api').toggle_ui`
- `require('muren.api').open_ui`
- `require('muren.api').close_ui`
- `require('muren.api').open_fresh_ui`
- `require('muren.api').open_unique_ui`


CONFIGURATION                            *muren.nvim-muren.nvim-configuration*

Pass settings to `require('muren').setup`. The current defaults are:

>lua
    {
      -- general
      create_commands = true,
      filetype_in_preview = true,
      -- default togglable options
      two_step = false,
      all_on_line = true,
      preview = true,
      cwd = false,
      files = '**/*',
      -- keymaps
      keys = {
        close = 'q',
        toggle_side = '<Tab>',
        toggle_options_focus = '<C-s>',
        toggle_option_under_cursor = '<CR>',
        scroll_preview_up = '<Up>',
        scroll_preview_down = '<Down>',
        do_replace = '<CR>',
      },
      -- ui sizes
      patterns_width = 30,
      patterns_height = 10,
      options_width = 20,
      preview_height = 12,
      -- options order in ui
      order = {
        'buffer',
        'dir',
        'files',
        'two_step',
        'all_on_line',
        'preview',
      },
      -- highlights used for options ui
      hl = {
        options = {
          on = '@string',
          off = '@variable.builtin',
        },
        preview = {
          cwd = {
            path = 'Comment',
            lnum = 'Number',
          },
        },
      },
    }

BASIC USAGE ~

Basic usage replacing variables `a_0`, `a_1` and `a_2` to `x`, `y` and `z`:

SWAPPING THINGS ~

Using non-recursive (2-step) replacements one can swap variables with ease
since they are first replaced to temporary placeholders. Toggle the option (see
below) to see the difference.


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23341710/233819106-8d08cacd-2adc-467c-a784-6f5e59ef6ca1.mp4


PICK OPTIONS INTERACTIVELY ~

You can change some options interactively while previewing your changes in the
UI.

Note in particular how things change in the preview.


POPULATE WITH UNIQUE PREVIUOUS SEARCH MATCHES ~

`:MurenUnique` might initially seem like a random command but something I find
very useful. What it does is it finds all the matches of your last search and
populates the unique set of these in the patterns pane of the UI. You can them
replace all of them in some way but importantly you can do this differently for
each unique match.

REGEXES ~

There is full support for builtin regex patterns. However this won’t work
then the `two_step` option is enabled:

RECURSIVE SEARCH-REPLACE IN DIRECTORY ~

By either pressing `<CR>` on `dir` or `files` in the options pan you enable
search-replace across all files in the `dir`ectory which matches the
`files`-pattern:


ETYMOLOGY                                    *muren.nvim-muren.nvim-etymology*

Here are two explanations for the name of the plugin, choose the one you like
the most: * `muren` stands for "MUltiple REplacements in Neovim". * _muren_ is
the swedish word for "the wall" and refers to the border between the
patterns-buffer and the replacements-buffer.
